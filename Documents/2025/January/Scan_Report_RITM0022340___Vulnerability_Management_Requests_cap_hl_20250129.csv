RC4 is known to have biases and the block cipher in CBC mode is vulnerable to the POODLE attack. 

TLSv1.0, if configured to use the same cipher suites as SSLv3, includes a means by which a TLS implementation can downgrade the connection to SSL v3.0, thus weakening security.

When the service path is a long name and contains a space and not quoted, the file name becomes ambiguous.
For example, consider the string ""c:\program files\sub dir\program name"". This string can be interpreted in a number of ways. The system tries to interpret the possibilities in the following order: 
c:\program.exe files\sub dir\program name 
c:\program files\sub.exe dir\program name 
c:\program files\sub dir\program.exe name  
If an attacker is able to place a malicious executable in one of these unexpected paths, sometimes escalate privileges if run as SYSTEM.
